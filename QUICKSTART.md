# Anime Recommendation System - Quick Start Guide

## Overview

This project implements a collaborative filtering-based anime recommendation system with both user-based and item-based approaches. The system suggests anime titles based on user rating patterns and preferences.

## Project Structure



## Quick Demo (No Dependencies Required)

Run the simplified demo that works with Python standard library only:



This demonstrates:
- ✅ User-based collaborative filtering
- ✅ Item-based collaborative filtering  
- ✅ Cosine similarity calculations
- ✅ Rating predictions
- ✅ Similar user/anime finding
- ✅ Sample data with 20 users and 10 popular anime

## Key Features

### 🎯 Recommendation Methods
- **User-based CF**: Finds similar users and recommends anime they liked
- **Item-based CF**: Recommends anime similar to ones user already rated highly

### 📊 Evaluation Metrics
- **RMSE/MAE**: Prediction accuracy
- **Coverage**: Percentage of recommendable items
- **Diversity**: Variety in recommendations
- **Performance**: Speed and scalability metrics

### 🛠️ Technical Implementation
- **Cosine Similarity**: For computing user/item similarities
- **Matrix Operations**: Efficient similarity calculations
- **Rating Prediction**: Weighted average of similar users/items
- **Cold Start Handling**: Popular items for new users

## Algorithm Details

### User-Based Collaborative Filtering
1. Build user-item rating matrix
2. Calculate user similarities using cosine similarity
3. For each unrated item, find k most similar users who rated it
4. Predict rating as weighted average of similar users' ratings
5. Recommend top-N highest predicted ratings

### Item-Based Collaborative Filtering
1. Build item-user rating matrix
2. Calculate item similarities using cosine similarity
3. For each unrated item, find k most similar items user has rated
4. Predict rating as weighted average of similar items' ratings
5. Recommend top-N highest predicted ratings

## Sample Output



## Extending the System

### Real Data Integration
- Replace sample data with MyAnimeList/AniList datasets
- Implement API connections for real-time data
- Handle larger scale datasets (millions of users/items)

### Algorithm Improvements
- Matrix factorization (SVD, NMF)
- Deep learning approaches (Neural CF, Autoencoders)
- Hybrid content + collaborative filtering
- Time-aware recommendations

### Production Features
- Online learning for real-time updates
- A/B testing framework
- Recommendation explanations
- Multi-armed bandit for exploration vs exploitation

## Performance Considerations

### Scalability Challenges
- **Memory**: O(users × items) for similarity matrices
- **Computation**: O(users²) for user similarities
- **Sparsity**: Real datasets often >99% sparse

### Optimization Strategies
- Sparse matrix representations
- Approximate similarity algorithms (LSH)
- Dimensionality reduction techniques
- Distributed computing for large datasets

## Educational Value

This project demonstrates:
- 📚 **Core ML Concepts**: Similarity measures, matrix operations
- 🔬 **Recommendation Systems**: Collaborative filtering fundamentals  
- 🧪 **Evaluation Methods**: Cross-validation, accuracy metrics
- 💻 **Software Design**: Modular, testable code architecture
- 📊 **Data Science**: Preprocessing, analysis, visualization

## Next Steps

1. **Experiment** with different similarity measures (Pearson correlation, Jaccard)
2. **Implement** matrix factorization techniques
3. **Add** content-based filtering using anime metadata
4. **Test** with real anime datasets from Kaggle
5. **Deploy** as a web service with REST API
